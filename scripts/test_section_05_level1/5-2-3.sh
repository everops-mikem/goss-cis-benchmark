# 5.2.3 Ensure permissions on SSH public host key files are configured
# configured (Automated)
#
# Description:
# An SSH public key is one of two files used in SSH public key authentication.
# In this authentication method, a public key is a key that can be used for
# verifying digital signatures generated using a corresponding private key. Only
# a public key that corresponds to a private key will be able to authenticate
# successfully.
#
# Rationale:
# If a public host key file is modified by an unauthorized user, the SSH service
# may be compromised.
